2. Right now the app shows 3 videos, but there are more in video-data.json. Load these videos as well and implement scrolling in the VideoList component.

3. Sort the videos so they display alphabetically by title.

4. This is not a design challenge, but use your best judgement to make the site look nice.

5. Make the selected video autoplay when a tile in the list is clicked.
